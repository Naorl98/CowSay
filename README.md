
# Cowsay-Naor Jenkins Pipeline

## Overview

This Jenkins pipeline is designed to automate the version control, Docker image creation, testing, and deployment processes for the Cowsay-Naor application. The pipeline facilitates continuous integration and deployment by leveraging AWS services, Docker containerization, and robust notification mechanisms.

## Pipeline Stages

- **Checkout Code**: Checks out the correct branch based on the specified release version, ensuring that the pipeline always works with the latest code.
- **Determine Version**: Dynamically calculates the next version number by incrementing the patch component and updates the version file in the repository.
- **Build Docker Image**: Constructs the Docker image and pushes it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storage.
- **E2E Tests**: Executes end-to-end tests by deploying the Docker container temporarily and verifying its operational status.
- **Deploy to EC2**: Deploys the Docker image to an Amazon EC2 instance, managing deployment logistics through SSH and AWS CLI commands.
- **Sanity Check**: After deployment, performs a sanity check by hitting the deployed applicationâ€™s endpoint to ensure it responds correctly.
- **Cleanup and Tag Release**: Post-deployment, cleans up the environment and tags the release in Git for version tracking.

## Notifications

- **Success**: Upon successful build and deployment, sends an email to the developer and posts a success message to a configured webhook.
- **Failure**: In case of failure, sends a notification email detailing the issue and posts a failure alert to the webhook.

## Environment Variables

Here is a list of environment variables used in the pipeline:
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID for resource management.
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region where resources are managed.
- `IMAGE_NAME`: Name of the Docker image.
- `REPO_NAME`: Name of the Docker repository.
- `ECR_URI`: URI of the AWS ECR.
- `EC2_INSTANCE_IP`: IP address of the target EC2 instance.
- `REMOTE_HOST`: Host for SSH connections.
- `ECR_REPO`: Full ECR repository path.
- `DEV_EMAIL`: Developer's email for notifications.
- `VERSION_FILE`: File containing the current application version.
- `BRANCH`: Git branch for checkout and deployment.

## Cleanup

Ensures all resources are properly cleaned up post-deployment to avoid unnecessary charges and clutter.

## Background
This is a minor re-write of [Cowsay Node](https://github.com/BibbyChung/cowsay-node) by Bibby Chung

It is adapted for course convenience.

Important note: Deepak Chopra is a quack.

## Features

1. show random "Deepak Chopra Quote".
2. put docker container to [bibbynet/cowsay-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/bibbynet/cowsay-node). 
 

## Build Container

```
docker build -t <YOUR CONTAINER NAME> .
```

## Run Container

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 <YOUR CONTAINER NAME>
```

## docker-compose

```
version: "3.5"

services:
  cow-say: 
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

## docker-compose from Docker Hub

```
version: "3.5"

services:
  cow-say: 
    image: bibbynet/cowsay-node
    ports:
